         <h3>Coffee Beans are not Beans at All!</h3>
           <p>Did you know coffee beans are not actually beans at all? They are actually the seeds of a fruit, the coffee cherry. Farmers harvest the cherries by hand during the harvest season which last from November until about February in Thailand.</p>

         <h3>Harvesting Coffee Cherries</h3>
           <p>Our farmers hand select (literally) the ripe coffee cherries to ensure the highest quality possible. This selection process is the most time consuming and labor intensive step in the process of coffee bean production. Once picked, our coffee is naturally "wet processed" by soaking the cherries in water during three different stages. Between each stage, imperfect beans are removed to ensure only the highest quality beans make it into your cup.</p>

         <h3>Processing Coffee</h3>
           <p>After the coffee has naturally dried for 7-10 days in the sun, the coffee beans are hand sorted to separate the imperfect from the perfect beans. Women from the local hill tribe work together to make sure that only the perfect Arabica beans are used to make your cup of specialty Kao Jai Coffee. One of the most important aspect of Kao Jai Coffee is the farming families that we directly buy our coffee from. These families, living in the Doi Chang Valley, work day in and day out to provide the highest quality specialty coffee beans without negatively impacting our environment.</p>

        <h3>It means this:</h3>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Kao Jai Coffee - Our name holds a lot of meaning. "Kao Jai" is a phrase in Thai meaning "to understand." We chose this name because we want to use coffee as a bridge to help people better understand people, places &amp products from around the world. </li>
              <li>Taste of Change - Our slogan, which focuses on the price paid, natural processing, our philanthropic model &amp unique tastes of Thai coffee.</li>
              <li>Thai Stamp - เข้าใจ is Kao Jai written in Thai, and the background is a drawing of actual hand-stitched patchwork that was created by women in our partner's village in Thailand.</li>
              <li>Single-Origin - All of our coffee, regardless of roast profile, comes from a single mountain in Northern Thailand. </li>
              <li>Pongladda (Doon) - Our partner, friend &amp inspiration who learned English for the sole purpose of helping farmers in Thailand share their coffee with people across the globe. We love and value her for her hard work, passion &amp dedication to the farmers and Thai coffee. </li>
              <li>Born in Thailand / Roasted in America - All coffee is sourced from Thailand but locally, small-batch roasted in Florida.</li>
              <li>Farmer Satisfied Price - The term we use to describe our pricing model which encompasses quality of coffee, processing type, Fair Trade price, cost of living &amp more.</li>

          <h3>The First Sip</h3>
            <p>Meg and her husband, Kyle, founded Kao Jai Coffee while teaching in Thailand. The story started while planning lessons at a local coffee shop when the waiter told them at the coffee they were drinking was from a local mountain.</p>
          <h3>First Trip to the Farm</h3>
            <p>Meg and Kyle essentially invited themselves to the mountain to see how coffee is grown, harvested and processed. During this trip they met the farmers and realized that they were living in poverty due to the lack of market for their phenomenal beans.</p>
          <h3>Thailand to America</h3>
            <p>After hardly any thought, Kyle and Meg knew that they wouldn't be able to change the farmer's situation entirely, but they couldn't pass up the opportunity to try. After shipping a sample to America, they started to build a webiste, social media channels and started a presale. Now, you can purchase Kao Jai Coffee on the shelves of local Kroger stores in Middle Tennessee!</p>
